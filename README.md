# Basic Educational Website

This is a basic educational website which I have designed and implemented using html and css, as an assignment in the 'Rapid Application Development & Visual Programming Techniques' course.

According to the guidelines, this is an online educational platform for a higher educational institute that delivers knowledge and model papers for Physics and Chemistry subjects.

The institute is willing to use its online educational platform for teaching practices.
